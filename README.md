# Cyngesheall

## Overview

**Cyngesheall** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game where players try to capture the opposing king while trying to reach the opposite corner with their own king.

## Background

**Cyngesheall** was conceived by John Beers in 2024 as a quasi-historical boardgame similar to both **Oferhlýp** and **Mǽrstánas** and uses the same 7x7 grid. However, instead of "checkers with hit points" or making connections with stones, **Cyngesheall** take more direct inspiration from Hnefatafl. Aside from the setup, the primary differentiation is that the number of player pieces is even instead of asymmetrical, and each player has a king, which must reach the opposite corner rather than an edge.
